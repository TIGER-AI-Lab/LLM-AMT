Your task is to rewrite the given medical question, not to answer it. Reformulate the given question by employing precise medical terminology. Focus on capturing the essence of the patient’s symptoms and conditions in a generalized form that reflects common clinical descriptions. Avoid using colloquial language and ensure that the rewritten query is clear, concise, and could be universally understood in a professional medical context. Do not include additional text or explanations outside the required response.

### Example:
Question: Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catheterization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man presents with decreased urinary output and malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. His medications prior to admission were insulin and naproxen, and he was started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His current vitals are: temperature 38°C (100.4°F), pulse 93/min, blood pressure 125/85 mm Hg. Examination reveals mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin count 14 g/dL, Leukocyte count 16,400/mm3, Segmented neutrophils 56%, Eosinophils 11%, Lymphocytes 31%, Monocytes 2%, Platelet count 260,000/mm3, Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 68 mm/h, Serum Urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL, Creatinine 4.2 mg/dL. Renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles.\nThe question is: Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
